# Hackmobility Ride Scheduler

  MEAN stack application: Our vision for an efficient ride scheduler. Our goal is to try and maximize ride and car sharing.

### Ride Share
  - Publish everyday routes ( commute to work), and other people and see the route and decide if they wanna join together. Or I can just joined other peoples routes.

### Car Share
  - When the car is not used by owner, it can be shared for other drivers
  - Show location, gas / electric range for roundtrip. Must return car to same location for the owner.
  - Set time frame for when the car is available

### Company Fleet
  - no need for roundtrips
  - use HERE Fleet telematics
